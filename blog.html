                    <H3 class="text-center">The Kite Incident</H3>
                    <p class="text-center">The other day I decided to purchase a kite off of Amazon. I thought, I loved flying kites as a kid and how cool would it be to teach my kids how to fly one. It‚Äôs been windy for the past 
                        month maybe 2. Every day the wind howls my kids toys in the back yard scatter across the backyard. The cushions and some of the furniture on my patio fly in the air some in the street on the other backside 
                        wall. I decided to make the best of a windy situation and buy the kite. A couple days later I get the package.  Kids see that its here and they are super excited (Me too!!). Its been
                        quite a while since I‚Äôve flown a kite literally close to 20 years.üò≥üò≥ YIKES!  So the day finally comes its been windy every day. How could it possibly not be the day I told the kids we would go‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶WELL‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..
                        The day started out great. We all wake up the winds blow amount. Kids as well as Pops super excited. My oldest has pre-school couple hours a couple days a week so we planned to go to the park on the way home
                        from school. We get to the park kids fighting and arguing who gets to do shit first you know the usual.  Kites brand new so I take it out of the package and try putting it together. Kids are trying to help‚Ä¶..
                        NOT HELPING. Not only that the wind is blowing the case and the package all over the field. I‚Äôm tryin to get the kids to hold stuff and now they‚Äôre fighting over who gets to hold stuff! Aahhhhh I grab them and 
                        shove them in my pocket. All while trying to hold down  the kite pieces that are trying to blow away.  Finally the time has come. I have the kite together string attached and the kids and I are ready to fly.
                        But the wind, you know  good old mother nature had other plans. It just stopped. I mean nothing. It was sad! The kids cried, I cried so we played on the jungle gym and went about our day. 

                            2 Weeks later


                        So the wind just left. I mean super windy every day for a month or so I finally get the kite we get it out there and nothing. Mother Nature said I need a break iv been blowing things all month‚Ä¶ SLUT.
                        Anyways its about 2 weeks later its HOT now. I get the kids all geared up to play in there little pool in the back yard. The sounds burning hot waters freezing cold. I start putting the canopy up to block
                        the sound and its trying to blow away. I like What the Fuck yo. Then Aspen goes ‚ÄúMan it‚Äôs windy enough for the kite‚Äù. Im like Lets ride. They of course were bolting for the door. So we got ready wind still
                        blowing and all. As soon as we got to the park. Dead. It just stopped, then out of nowhere it would gust up like it was teasing me. The kite would start to go up  and then just stall. And mock me as it slows
                        lowered to the ground. I would run back and fourth trying to get this kite to get up and as soon as I thought it was up and flying‚Ä¶.. Slowly it would just fall back down to earth.  Slowly one by one my kids 
                        gave up on me. Dad can we just go play at the park, Dad its hot, Dad can we go home! They trickled away  like the sweat running down my face. I couldnt give up. There was no way I came to the park twice and was 
                        punked by mother nature. Back and fourth I ran from left to right East to West. Nothing‚Ä¶. I lay there defeated out of breath dripping sweat. I took a deep breath tucked my pride in my pocket‚Ä¶. Lets go home and get pizza. 
                        As I sit at home with a cold beer in my hand and my feet in the water. At least I got cardio in.gevdbgbbhncdjxjnhjh√∫3    x Till we meet again mother nature.
